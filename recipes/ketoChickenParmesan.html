    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A delicious keto-friendly chicken Parmesan. Enjoy a classic Italian dish, and keep your macros in check!</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 ½ ounces pork rinds, crushed</li>
        <li>1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ cup jarred tomato sauce (such as Rao's®)</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Slice chicken breast through the middle horizontally from one side to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Pound chicken flat until about 1/2-inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>Beat egg and cream together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine crushed pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, ground black pepper, and Italian seasoning in bowl; transfer breading to a plate.</li>
        <li>Dip chicken into egg mixture; coat completely. Press chicken into breading; thickly coat both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add ghee. Place chicken in the pan; cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Be careful to keep breading in place.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Cover with tomato sauce; top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Broil until cheese is bubbling and barely browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
